# To decrypt already stored data, run the program with the -h flag, some parameters are required,
# this config will be ignored in "replay mode"

# Ports to listen, if run via ../run/docker-compose.yml, these need to match with the ones exposed there, else won't work

# The clients use the public counterpart

# Perfomance tweaking
# NOTE: Increasing buffer sizes will increase memory consumption accordingly
# Network packet buffer, increase if the size of the packets are bigger
PacketBufferSize = 8092
# Batch size to store logs, adjust according to number of logs received per second, this is the Influx batch size as well

# Buffer size for the channel receiving packets (number of packets allowed to be queued), increase if the data ingestion is lagging

# Buffer size for all processing channels (after they are received), increase if the data writting/Influx/decryption is lagging
ProcessingChannelBuffer = 1000
# Store blob compressed or not to save space, increases processor usage/processing time at storage/replay, but saves around 30% of disk usage
